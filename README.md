# Diversity & Inclusion Workforce Analysis

This project explores global workforce diversity using publicly available organizational data, with a focus on gender, race/ethnicity, and self-identified identity groups. The goal is to uncover disparities in representation, hiring, and attrition across regions and workforce categories, and to provide data-driven insight for improving Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts.

## 📁 Project Overview

This analysis was completed as a final class project for STAT 184 (Data Science through R Programming). It includes full R Markdown code, visualizations, and a narrative discussion that follows best practices in data wrangling, visualization, and communication.

### Research Question:
> How do gender, racial/ethnic, and self-identified identity representation and attrition vary across regions and workforce roles in a global tech workforce?

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Gender Disparities**: EMEA outperforms the Americas and APAC in female hiring, but attrition for women remains higher in several regions.
- **Racial Representation**: White/European employees dominate leadership roles across all regions, while groups like Indigenous and MENA remain underrepresented.
- **Self-ID Trends**: LGBTQ+, disability, and military self-identification have declined since 2019—raising concerns about workplace psychological safety and disclosure culture.
