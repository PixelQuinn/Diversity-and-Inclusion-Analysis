# Diversity & Inclusion Workforce Analysis

This project explores global workforce diversity using organizational data, with a focus on gender, race/ethnicity, and self-identified identity groups. The goal is to uncover disparities in representation, hiring, and attrition across regions and workforce categories, and to provide data-driven insights for improving Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts.

## 📁 Project Overview

This analysis was completed as a final class project for STAT 184 (Data Science through R Programming) and refined into a professional portfolio project. It includes full R Markdown code, data wrangling, exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and narrative business insights.

### Research Question
> How do gender, racial/ethnic, and self-identified identity representation and attrition vary across regions and workforce roles in a global tech workforce?

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Gender Disparities**: EMEA outperforms the Americas and APAC in hiring women, but no region has achieved gender parity. Men still show consistently higher attrition rates compared to women across regions and workforce types.
- **Racial Representation**: White/European employees dominate leadership roles across all regions, while Indigenous and MENA groups remain underrepresented.
- **Self-ID Trends**: LGBTQ+, disability, and military self-identification rates have declined since 2019, raising concerns about psychological safety and workforce disclosure practices.
- **Predictive Modeling**: A multivariable linear regression model explained ~64% of attrition index variance, identifying gender as the strongest predictive factor, while region, workforce type, and time showed no statistically significant impact.
